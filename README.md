Hello Hello and welcome to my portfolio!!

I divided my Portfolio in 6 section including the navbar and the footer. I wanted to have 2 main color for the all page and navigate between these colors to keep it simple(less is better sometimes ^^). Here are some details for the differents section: 
 
 **Navbar: i went with a sticky navbar, i found that very practical and will allowed the user to navigate between the differents section very quickly. I added my CV in PDF mode in the navbar. I didn't change the set up for tablets only for phones.

 **Hero: I went straight to the point and played a little bit with CSS.

 **About: This section i talked a little bit about myself and added a picture. I added my skills under the presentation. The set up will adapt according to the device.

 **Projects: I went with a display of 3 projects (even if right now i only have one). As we hover on the card project it will zoom and details of the projects will be explained. The set up will also adapt according to the device.

 **Contacts: I went a bit more funky and added a vector. We can directly click on the "send me an email" if we preffer to type in mail application. I also put the option of the forms. The border under the input will change color when active. And both buttons have some hover effects that remind the color of the vector. In the forms i added an instagram and linkdin. For the momenti don't have a profil on linkdin so the link leed nowhere same for the instagram. In the future both of them will be active and the idea is to have an instagram where i share ressource that help me be better at coding (video, profils...). The set up will also adapt according to the device.


 **Footer: I added a footer to have a closure of the page. The set up will also adapt according to the device.

 Overall the project made me very humble, i added to lower down my expections and be very patient with myself. I focused on delivering something clean in the code but also in the page. The journey only started and i am very proud where i am so far and very eager to bet better so i can apply my ideas.

 Thank you for the support :D
